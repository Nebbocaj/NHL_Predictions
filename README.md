# NHL_Predictions

This is a website for making various predictions for the National Hockey League (NHL). The goal is to include odds about which teams will make the playoffs at any given point in the season, which players will win individial awards, create power rankings for players and teams, and create informative graphics for all information presented.

## Current Goals

1. Build an algorithm that takes a year and day as parameters and tracks the team statistics up until that day. This function will be used in the next steps.
2. Build an algorithm that can provide the chances that a team will make the playoffs if there is a 50% chance that any team can win any game.
3. Look into the most efficient ways to meassure a "power level" for teams to give better accuracies.
